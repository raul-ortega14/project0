It's a first try to write my own web portfolio. It contains 4 html: homepage, projects, skills and contact
 which can be be found in the navigation bar at the bottom.

- homepage: contains some introductory info, and a simple blinking animation
- projects: contains a table with the name, date and skills used in my projects and images for my projects 
with a short description of those projects
- skills: some more info of my studies
- contact: simple contact form with name, email, text and send button (doesnt do anything, it's just a display, it is not connected yet to anything)
